Programming Contest: API Integration
Challenge
Overview
Welcome to our programming contest! Your task is to create a Java web application using
Apache Tomcat server. The application will fetch data from three different APIs at the push of
a button and display the results in an HTML table.
APIs to Use
1. Cat Facts: Fetch random cat facts.
○ API URL: https://catfact.ninja/fact
2. Dog Images: Get random images of dogs.
○ API URL: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
3. Bitcoin Prices: Retrieve the current price of Bitcoin.
○ API URL: https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json

Requirements
● Java Web Application: Your application should be a Java web application running
on Apache Tomcat server.

● Button Functionality: There should be a button on the webpage. When this button
is pressed, your application should simultaneously make requests to the above three
API endpoints.

● Display Results: Once all API responses are received, display the results in an
HTML table on the same page. Ensure that the table is well-formatted and easy to
read.

● Include Dog Image: For the dog images API, ensure that the actual image is
displayed in the table.



Second Step:
● Optimization: Your application should be optimized for speed, running the 3 API
calls in parallel so the order of the table should result in different order



Third Step:
● OOP: Object oriented programming should be implemented in your application
